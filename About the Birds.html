<p>Birds need places where they can hide from predators and inclement weather.
    Trees, shrubs, meadows, and even rock walls provide such shelter. Natural sources: Native trees and shrubs of different densities and heights give birds places of retreat and safety</p>

<p>Duo is a friendly little fella. Unless you don't do your French lessons. He will peck at you until you finish your daily lessons.</p>
