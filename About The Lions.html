<p>Lions inhabit a wide range of habitats, from open plains to thick brush and dry thorn forest.
    Except for a small population of the Indian lion subspecies that remains in the Gir Forest of northwest India, lions now live only in Africa, from the Sahara's southern fringe to northern South Africa.</p>

<p>Alex is the most famous lion in NYC. He can be found admiring his fans or hanging out with his friends.</p>

<p>Patrick is a very lazy lion. He just hangs out in the shade most of the time. When he does get up, he just goes to eat or drink.</p>
