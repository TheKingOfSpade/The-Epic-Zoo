<p>Penguin habitats include oceans and coasts. They generally live on islands and remote continental regions with few land predators, where their inability to fly is not detrimental to their survival.
    They are adapted to living at sea, and some species can spend months at a time at sea.</p>
<h2>Skipper the Penguin</h2>

<p>Skipper is a little guy who likes to get into trouble. You can catch him and his brothers doing some funny things. You can see them drop kick a octopus, or do kun-fu with a panda.</p>

<p>Gunther is a strange little fella. You usually see him chilling in the ice cave and rarley gets out. But when he does get out, he is as active as a dog.</p>
